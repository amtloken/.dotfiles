# What are these?

`dotfiles` are configuration files used to personalize Linux- and Unix
based systems. The name `dotfiles` stems from the file names starting
with a dot. A leading dot in a file or folder name indicates that the
file or folder is hidden. This repo contains my personal `dotfiles`.
They are stored here for convenience, so that I can simply access them
on new machines, or fresh installs. Eventually, others may potentially
find them inspirational for their own configurations.

# How to use these?

Key word: `GNU Stow`. It's like magic. Nøkkelord: `GNU Stow`. Rett og
slett ren magi.

license. It facilitates use, copying, changing, distribution, sale, and

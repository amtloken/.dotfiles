* What are these?
=dotfiles= are configuration files used to personalize Linux- and Unix based
systems. The name =dotfiles= stems from the file names starting with a dot.
A leading dot in a file or folder name indicates that the file or folder is
hidden. This repo contains my personal =dotfiles=. They are stored here for
convenience, so that I can simply access them on new machines, or fresh 
installs. Eventually, others may potentially find them inspirational for their
own configurations.

* How to use these?
Key word: =GNU Stow=. It's like magic.
Nøkkelord: =GNU Stow=. Rett og slett ren magi. 

* Licensing
The files in this repo are licenses under GPLv3, which is a very liberal license.
It facilitates use, copying, changing, distribution, sale, and more, of the 
software. For further details, see the LICENSE file, or
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
